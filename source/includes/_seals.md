# Resource - Seals

The Seals resource offers the needed endpoints to retrieve information about the available vehicle seals that are supported by the AutoScout24 marketplace.

## Retrieve Seals List

> ###Endpoint
> `GET` /seals

> ###Request Example
> Get the list of seals that are supported by AutoScout24:

```shell

curl https://api.autoscout24.com/seals \
     -X GET \
     -H "X-AS24-Version: 1.1" \
     -H "Accept-Language: en-GB" 
```

Retrieve a list of supported car seals.

- Response also shows for which country a given *seal* is valid for (e.g. German dealers should only attach German used car seals to their vehicles).
- Please note that all vehicles possessing a used car seal are subject to further checks by AutoScout24. Vehicles might therefore be listed without the initially requested car seal.
