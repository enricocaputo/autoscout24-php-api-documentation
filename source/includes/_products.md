# Resource - Products

The Products resource is a sub-resource of the Vehicle resource. It manages the lifecycle of advertising products that can be atached to an existing vehicle. 

## Book an Ad Product

> ###Endpoint
> `POST` /vehicles/{vehicleId}/products

> ###Request Example
> Book a premium ad product for a vehicle with id = 7e59591f-c5a3-974e-e452-2951040ae4ee:

```shell

curl https://api.autoscout24.com/vehicles/7e59591f-c5a3-974e-e452-2951040ae4ee/products \
     -X POST \
     -H "X-AS24-Version: 1.1" \
     -H "Accept-Language: en-GB" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer e7c00b24-9f5f-4909-88de-38f8d7ca08bf" \
     -d '{ \
            "productId": "T30", \
            "subtitle": "Amazing Car" \
         }'
```

Attach an ad product to an existing vehicle. 

Please note that product bookings will be charged to the dealer in question on a daily basis.

For product bookings an optional subtitle can be posted (Type=string, maxLength=55). 
Subtitles will be shown as part of the vehicle information on a search result list page. The additional subtitle can be used to further highlight specific features of a vehicle.

**Semantic Rules**

The following semantic rules are applied when booking an ad product to a vehicle.

**Allowed products ( Only for dealers in Germany, France, Belgium, Luxemburg):**

T30 = PremiumInserat
(max. 30 images will be shown as part of the vehicle ad)

T20 = PlusInserat
(max. first 20 images will be shown as part of the vehicle ad)

**Important information:**

Attention: Product bookings for „PremiumInserat“ (T30) or „PlusInserat“ (T20) via API are being rejected if the dealer has activated automatic booking rules for his stock on AutoScout24.de.
Either T30 or T20 can be attached to a vehicle – not both at the same time.
**Should you wish to switch from T30 to T20 or vice versa you must delete the existing product booking first.**

Detailed information on these ad products in Germany can be found by clicking <a href="http://ww2.autoscout24.de/partner-infoportal/b2b-marketing-power.aspx">here</a>.
